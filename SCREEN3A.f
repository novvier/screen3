C              EPA
C              RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, NC 27711
C
C        MODIFICATION DATE:
C
C              FEBRUARY 12, 2013
C
C        MODIFICATIONS INCLUDE:
C
C              1)  Recompiled to 32-bit.  We are finding that our recompiled 
C                  32-bit executables will run on Windows 7, x64 operating 
C                  systems.
C      
C              2)  The length of CINP had to be increased from 50 to 80.
C
C              3)  The capability to open a fixed filename, SCREEN.INP, was 
C                  added but not implemented.  The following line was 
C                  added to initialize the input filename variable, INPFIL:
C
C                     INPFIL = 'SCREEN.INP'
C
C              4)  If a fixed filename is required under another operating 
C                  system, the following statement needs to be uncommented
C                  before recompiling:
C
C                     C       OPEN(IRD,FILE=INPFIL,STATUS='OLD')
C
C              5)  There were too many commas in Format statement 103 near 
C                  line number 1943.  The commas were removed.
C
C              6)  The version number, VERSN, was changed in Block Init 
C                  from 96043 to 13043.
C
C              7)  In the CALL PRISE statement, the scalar variable, xnw, was 
C                  being passsed to the dimensioned variable, xdown. xdown was 
C                  always dimensioned to "1".  In Subroutine PRISE, xdown was 
C                  changed to the scalar, xnw.  The same was true for z and 
C                  zeff.  These two variables were changed to znw and zefflgl.
C
C              8)  xnw, znw, and zefflgl were equated to their dimensioned 
C                  counterparts.
C
C              9)  The compiler objected to mixed integer and floating point 
C                  variable arguments in the function AMAX1.  The value 10 was
C                  changed to a float point value by adding a decimal point.  
C                  There were two other instances of this happening.  All 
C                  three statements were edited.
C
C             10)  G10.4 formats were widened to G11.4 at the suggestion of 
C                  compiler.
C
C             11)  Source code SCREEN3C.FOR was not modified.
C
C             12)  Further code change details are in Model Change Bulletin #3.

C        MODIFICATIONS INCLUDE:
C
C              THE NEW ANEMOMETER HEIGHT ROUTINE WAS MOVED TOWARD THE
C              BEGINNING OF THE CODE.  THE ROUTINE WAS PREVIOUSLY PLACED
C              AFTER THE COMPLEX TERRAIN ALGORITHM WHICH NEEDS AN ANEMOMETER
C              HEIGHT.  THE INPUT SEQUENCE WAS ALSO ALTERED TO ACCOMODATE THE
C              NEW ALGORITHM ROUTINE.  SEVERAL OUTPUT STATEMENTS WERE ADDED
C              OR ENHANCED TO REFLECT THE USE OF THE NEW OPTIONS.
C
C              THE ADDITION OF THREE NON-REGULATORY OPTIONS:
C                1. AN ANEMOMETER HEIGHT OTHER THAN 10 METERS CAN NOW BE
C                   ENTERED AS AN OPTION, AND
C                2. THE ABILITY TO PRODUCE RESULTS THAT ARE CONSERVATIVE
C                   WITH RESPECT TO ISCST3 RESULTS.  OPTION 2, FROM THE
C                   R. BRODE PAPER GIVEN AT THE 1991 SEVENTH JOINT CONFERENCE
C                   ON APPLICATIONS OF AIR POLLUTION METEOROLOGY WITH AWMA,
C                   WAS ADDED AS AN OPTION.  THIS OPTION MINIMIZES THE MIXING
C                   HEIGHTS FOR UNSTABLE CASES THUS CREATING RESULTS THAT ARE
C                   MORE CONSERVATIVE WITH RESPECT TO ISCST2 RESULTS.
C                3. THE ADDITION OF THE SCHULMAN-SCIRE (1993) CAVITY
C                   FORMULATION FROM AN ARTICLE IN THE AUGUST 1993 OF AIR AND
C                   WASTE (JOURNAL OF THE AIR AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
C                   ASSOCIATION).
C
C              ALSO PROGRAMMED INTO THIS SOURCE CODE IS THE ABILITY TO USE
C                   PREVIOUS DATA SETS WITHOUT HAVING TO RE-EDIT THE DATA
C                   FOR CASES WHERE THE OPTIONS ARE NOT EXERCISED.

C        MODIFICATIONS INCLUDE:
C
C              INCORPORATION OF THE MODIFIED AREA SOURCE ALGORITHM
C              BASED ON THE ISCST3 MODEL (DATED 95250).
C              THIS NEW ALGORITHM USES A NUMERICAL INTEGRATION OF THE
C              POINT SOURCE FUNCTION OVER THE AREA TO ESTIMATE IMPACTS.
C              IT ALLOWS FOR RECTANGULAR-SHAPED AREAS, AND ALSO WILL
C              ESTIMATE IMPACTS WITHIN THE AREA ITSELF.  SINCE MAXIMUM
C              IMPACTS AT A GIVEN DISTANCE ARE A FUNCTION OF WIND
C              DIRECTION FOR RECTANGULAR AREAS, THE MODEL SEARCHES
C              THROUGH A RANGE OF WIND DIRECTIONS BASED ON A SERIES OF
C              LOOK-UP TABLES (AS A FUNCTION OF STABILITY CLASS, ASPECT
C              RATIO AND NORMALIZED DOWNWIND DISTANCE) TO DETERMINE THE
C              MAXIMUM IMPACT.  THE USER ALSO HAS THE OPTION OF SPECIFYING
C              A WIND DIRECTION ORIENTATION RELATIVE TO THE LONG DIMENSION
C              OF THE AREA.
C
C              A DRY DEPOSITION ALGORITHM BASED ON THE DEPST MODEL HAS ALSO
C              BEEN ADDED, BUT HAS NOT BEEN ACTIVATED.  THIS ALGORITHM IS
C              NOT COMPLETELY CONSISTENT WITH THE DRY DEPOSITION ALGORITHM
C              IN THE ISCST3 MODEL.
C
C              TWO MINOR BUGS WERE ALSO CORRECTED.  ONE BUG ALLOWED
C              FUMIGATION CALCULATIONS TO BE PERFORMED FOR FLARE SOURCES
C              UNDER URBAN CONDITIONS.  THE OTHER BUG INVOLVED USE OF
C              AN ERRORNEOUS VARIABLE NAME WHEN CHECKING FOR A NEGATIVE
C              SOURCE WIDTH FOR AREA SOURCES.

C
C              UPDATING CODE FOR COMPATIBILITY WITH ISCST2 (92062).
C              THIS ESPECIALLY INCLUDES DOWNWASH ALGORITHMS.  SCREEN
C              MODEL CODE, ESPECIALLY SUBROUTINE USERX, HAS BEEN
C              RESTRUCTURED SLIGHTLY TO MAKE MAXIMUM USE OF ISC2
C              CALCULATION ROUTINES.
C
C              AREA SOURCE ALGORITHM IN SCREEN HAS BEEN MODIFIED
C              TO USE FINITE LINE SEGMENT APPROACH FOR COMPATIBILITY
C              WITH ISCST2 (92062).  DISTANCES ARE NOW MEASURED FROM
C              THE CENTER OF THE AREA (RATHER THAN FROM DOWNWIND EDGE
C              AS DONE WITH PREVIOUS VIRTUAL POINT SOURCE IMPLEMENTATION).
C              INPUT EMISSIONS ARE NOW IN GRAMS/(SEC-M**2), FOR
C              CONSISTENCY WITH ISCST2.
C
C              A NEW VOLUME SOURCE OPTION HAS BEEN ADDED FOR CONSISTENCY
C              WITH ISCST2 (92062).  USES A VIRTUAL POINT SOURCE APPROACH.
C
C              MODIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE ITERATION ROUTINE TO
C              SEARCH FOR THE PEAK CONCENTRATION, AND F STABILITY HAS
C              BEEN ADDED TO THE URBAN OPTION.  ADDITIONAL WIND SPEEDS
C              IN 0.5 M/S INCREMENTS HAVE BEEN ADDED FOR SPEEDS < 5 M/S.
C              THESE CHANGES ARE INTENDED TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF
C              SCREEN AS A CONSERVATIVE SCREENING TOOL RELATIVE TO ISCST2.
C
C              AN OPTION HAS BEEN ADDED TO INPUT THE VOLUMETRIC FLOW
C              RATE FOR STACK (i.e. POINT) RELEASES IN LIEU OF STACK

c
c --- PURPOSE:
c     This is a screening version of the cavity model proposed by Schulman
c     and Scire (J. Air Waste Manage. Assoc., 43, 1122-1127, August 1993).
c     The model concepts are:
c        1. Momentum rise and bending over of the plume leads to increased
c           entrainment , and hence an initial dilution, near the stack.
c        2. Buoyancy and momentum rise lead to a fractional capture of the
c           plume by the near-wake, rather than an all-or-nothing approach.
c           The plume height and vertical plume dimensions at the end of
c           the near wake are used to estimate the fraction captured.
c        3. A virtual source is used for sigma-z to account for the plume
c           diameter near the source. The minimum vertical dimension at x=0
c           is the stack diameter and a top hat distribution is assumed.
c        4. The portion of the plume captured by the near-wake is assumed
c           to be a diffusing plume that follows a concentration-distance
c           dilution relationship. The maximum concentration, for screening
c           purposes, is calculated at the closest ground-level location in
c           the near-wake (the base of the lee wall) using the stretched-string
c           distance from the top of the stack.
c        5. The concentration is calculated as the sum of two dilution
c           components acting on the plume, an initial dilution D1 and
c           a distance dilution DS.
c                                     C = C0/(D1+DS)
c                                     D1= 1+B1(Ta/Ts)*(w/u(hs))**2
c                                     DS= u(hb)*s**2/(B0*w*A)
c
c
c           At large s:
c                                     C=B0*Q/(u(hb)*s**2)
c
c           At s=0 and no momentum:
c                                     C=Q/(w*A)
c
c           At small s with momentum:
c                                     C=Q/(w*A(1+B1(Ta/Ts)*(w/u(hs))**2))
c
c                 where u(hb) is incident wind speed at roof-level,
c                       u(hs) is incident wind speed at stack-top,
c                       s is stretched-string distance, C is concentration,
c                       C0 is stack gas concentration, w is exhaust speed,
c                       A is stack area, Ta is ambient temperature,
c                       Ts is exhaust temperature, and B0 and
c                       B1 are constants.
